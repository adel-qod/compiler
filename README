     Adel C Compiler

This is a C compiler targeting x86_64 Linux systems with some planned aditions
Not everything in C will be implemented 

Reason? I like compilers

The language used for this project is python 3.2.
Why?
I am doing this for learning/fun so I wanna use a language that can be make 
  as productive as possible (maybe I'll do a re-write using Haskel later, who
  knows)

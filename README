     Adel C Compiler

This is a C compiler targeting x86_64 Linux systems.
Reason? I like compilers

The language used for this project is C99.
Why?
	Because C++ sucks as a language, loads of time is spent taking care of
	too many ugly corner cases and details instead of getting the job done.
	It adds some benefits like a nice standard library but I can get away
	with implementing what I need from it.
	Generics? They're not exactly needed here.
	Object Oriented Programming? Get over it, just because people used that
	model for the last 15 years does not make it the best way to organize a
	system.
The compiler used:
    	Clang: Better error messages than gcc and not much of a performance drop.

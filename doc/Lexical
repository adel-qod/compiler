This file describes the lexical structure of the language this project is going
to compile [source language]

The description here is gonna be written in regular expressions; the file is
organized as follows:
1- Supported reserved words
2- Supported special characters (for operators etc.)
3- Identifiers
4- String and character literals
5- Comments
6- Numbers: Integers & floating point
7- Notes about implementation

-Each pattern has a corresponding token and optional value attribute described below

1- Supported reserved words:
   if	     IF
   else	     ELSE
   switch    SWITCH
   case	     CASE
   default   DEFAULT
   while     WHILE
   for	     FOR
   break     BREAK
   continue  CONTINUE 
   int	     T_INT
   float     T_FLOAT
   char	     T_CHAR
   void	     VOID
   unsigned  UNSIGNED
   const     CONST
   return    RET
   extern    EXTERN
   static    STATIC
   struct    STRUCT
   sizeof    SIZEOF
   in	     IN (additional - check semantics document)

2- Other tokens:
Comparison operators:
   <         LT  
   >	     MT
   >=	     MEQ
   <=	     LEQ
   ==	     EQ
   !=	     NEQ
Logical operators:
   &&	     LOG_AND
   ||	     LOG_OR
   !	     LOG_NOT
Bit-wise operations:
   &         BIT_AND
   |	     BIT_OR
   ~	     BIT_NOT
   ^	     BIT_XOR
Misc:
   +	     PLUS
   -	     MINUS
   *	     ASTERISK 
   /	     DIV
   =	     assignment
   @	     AT (used as an addition to the language, use described in semantics doc)
Grouping:
   (         LEFT_PAREN
   )         RIGHT_PAREN
   {         LEFT_BRACE
   }	     RIGHT_BRACE
   [	     LEFT_BRACKET
   ]	     RIGHT_BRACKET
   ;	     SEMI_COLON
   ,	     COMMA
   '	     SING_QUOTE
   "	     DOUB_QUOTE

Helpers:
   LETTER: [a-zA-Z]
   NUMBER: [0-9]
   ID_CHAR: LETTER|NUMBER|_
   
3- Identifiers:
   [_LETTER]+ID_CHAR*	ID	Lexeme 

4- String and character literals:
   '.?'	      		CHAR	Lexeme
   ".*"			STRING	Lexeme

5- Comments:
   /*(.*)*/		SKIP (no action)

6- Numbers:
   NUMBER+	INT	Lexeme
   NUMBER+.NUMBER+	FLOAT	Lexeme

7- Notes about implementation:
How to read the input:
    We use buffered IO to speed reading from the file; the buffer size should
    ideally be equal to the file block size
    
Reserved words:
    We'll build a table containing all reserved key-words.
    When we're trying to recognize a pattern, we check if it's int he table and
    if it's not then we'll consider the lexeme we found to be an identifier.

Recognizing:
    The code is straight forward, we read the stream one character at a time
    and check what type of char we have and accordingly behave, if a letter; we
    try to recognize an ID or a reserved word, if a number, we keep consuming
    the numbers that follow; and same approach is used to extract the rest of
    the tokens.

    Important note about usage:
    use the function scan() to extract the tokens from the file; it returns at
    least three parameters with an optional fourth:
    Token ID, row number of the first char of the token, col number of the first
    char of the token, [the actual lexeme in case of IDs, literals, numbers and comments]

    Comments:
    Note that scan() returns and recognizes comments as tokens, if you don't
    want this behavior, wrap it with a function that calls scan() again should
    it get a comment.
